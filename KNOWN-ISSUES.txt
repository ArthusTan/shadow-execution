CORE UTILITIES (25/100).

During interpretation:
==============
Unhandled type for IValue (11)
   basename list.txt
   cat list.txt
   ./chmod.out +x temp.txt (unhandled type?) argument i1 is not
   allocated, instruction that uses it is skipped during
   instrumentation, so a store that uses it fails to access IValue.
    ./cp.out list.txt temp.txt
   ./chown.out root temp.tx (unhandled type?)
   ./chgrp.out staff /usr/local (unhandled type?)
   ./cksum.out list.txt

   wc list.txt

Negative internal offset (1)
   	 ./ln.out -s list.txt list.txt.2 
    ./dircolors.out
    ./truncate.out -s 5 list.txt (negative internal offset)
   paste list.txt list.txt	

Failed load assertion

Seg fault (19) (pending to check)
    ./rm.out list.txt (store of global variable)
    ./tail -10 list.txt (getelementptr)
    uptime (in getelementptr_array)
   ./realpath.out -L list.txt (in store)
   ./split.out -b 22 list.txt list (in alloca struct)
    ./cut.out -c2 list.txt (after call)
   ./csplit.out -f xyz list.txt 11 72 98 (in load)

Failed assertion at KIND_GetSize (2)
   fmt list.txt (in getelementptr struct/from a global value)
    md5sum list.txt (in getelementptr array)

Mismatch at store (14)
    ./comm.out list.txt list.txt (previously pointer constant)
    ./dirname.out /usr/local
    ./kill.out pid (mismatch when storing int8)
    ./pr.out list.txt (AFTER STRUCT CALL missing interpretation)
    ./sleep.out 2 (AFTER STRUCT CALL missing interpretation)
    ./timeout.out 1 sleep 10; date (AFTER STRUCT CALL missing interpretation)
   ./shred.out list.txt
