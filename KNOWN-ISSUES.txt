Global variables: arrays and structs.
String constants (see string.c).
Loading struct pointer (struct-return, ls).
Alloca creating bit failing (size returned is zero). To reproduce: sum.bc.
Unimplemented interpretation for instructions such as landingpad. It does not happen to execute because it is executed only in the case of an exception.  
Upgrade to LLVM 3.3.

Core utilities:

During interpretation:
==============
Strings
	cat

Don't support bit right now:
      ln -s list.txt list.txt.2

Seg fault
    printenv
    rm list.txt
    uname
    unexpand list.txt
    tty
    tr abc ABC
    truncate -s 5 list.txt
    tee (usage: ls | ./tee.out out)
