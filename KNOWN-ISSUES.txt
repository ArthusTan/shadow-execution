Global variables: arrays and structs.
String constants (see string.c).
Loading struct pointer (struct-return, ls).
Alloca creating bit failing (size returned is zero). To reproduce: sum.bc.
Unimplemented interpretation for instructions such as landingpad. It does not happen to execute because it is executed only in the case of an exception.  
Upgrade to LLVM 3.3.

Core utilities:

During interpretation:
==============
Strings
   cat
   id
   mktemp testingXXX
   nl list.txt
   paste list.txt list.txt	

Don't support bit right now:
    ln -s list.txt list.txt.2

Seg fault
    dircolors
    dirname /usr/local
    env
    expand list.txt
    join list.txt list.txt
    nohup time (or nohup)
    printenv
    rm list.txt
    sha1sum list.txt
    sha224sum list.txt
    sha256sum list.txt
    sha384sum list.txt
    sha512sum list.txt
    uname
    unexpand list.txt
    tty
    tr abc ABC
    truncate -s 5 list.txt
    tee (usage: ls | ./tee.out out)

Failed assertion at call_nounwind:
   fmt list.txt 
   uptime
   wc

Failed assertion at KIND_GetSize:
   false --version
   fold -5 list.txt
   groups
   head list.txt
   nproc
   pinky
   runcon
   sum list.txt
   split -b 22 list.txt list
   tac list.txt
   true --version
   FIXED: users
   uniq list.txt
   FIXED: whoami

Mismatch at store:
   readlink
   realpath
   sync
   tsort list.txt
   unlink list.txt

Failed assertion at phinode:
   kill pid (it did get to the point at which it killed the process).


During instrumentation:
===============
Unsupported KVALUE type.
    date

    ls
    mv
    pr
    sleep

Broken module:
   df 
   numfmt
   mkdir
   printf
   rmdir

Failed assertion at CallInstrumenter:

Failed assertion at getelementptr_array:

Failed assertion at getGlobalIndex:

Passing:
=====
   echo
   hostid
   link list.txt link.txt
   logname
   mkfifo temp (it creates a file...)
   nice
   pwd
   users
   whoami


Next: dd
