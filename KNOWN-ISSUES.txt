Global variables: arrays and structs.
String constants (see string.c).
Loading struct pointer (struct-return, ls).
Alloca creating bit failing (size returned is zero). To reproduce: sum.bc.
Unimplemented interpretation for instructions such as landingpad. It does not happen to execute because it is executed only in the case of an exception.  
DONE: Upgrade to LLVM 3.3.
DONE: New bitcode utilities with clang 3.3.
DONE: Function pointers. 
DONE: Intrinsic functions with side effects (e.g., llvm.copy) 
DONE: Modelling phi instruction 

KNOW ISSUES:
  Padding make concrete and shadow memory model inconsistent.

TESTING:
  Checking at store
  Checking for branch divergence
  TODO:
    Model printf to check stdout
  COMMENT: 
    We also have syncing at load

TODO:
review bitwise operators.
printing operators makes it very helpful.
comparison fixing.
	   why would pwd go through?
checking for divergence.
how to compare two utilities.
output and logging info.
ptrtoint.
check in example (example + foo).
re-run everything.
